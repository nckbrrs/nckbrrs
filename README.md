# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nick, a professional software engineer and amateur just-about-everything-else living in New York City.

Check out a few websites I've built lately with NextJS/React, Typescript, Tailwind, and more:

## [Nick Barrs](https://www.nickbarrs.com)

My personal landing page. Soon, I'd like to add some more personal content and expression, like what I've been listening to lately, where I've traveled, and other interests. Stay tuned!

Web app that I built so my wife and I could gather contact info and RSVPs from and provide information to our invitees before our wedding. Since the wedding has passed, it no longer has any active forms, but at the time, I used a Redis+ExpressJS backend to receive and store info from invitees, and even allow them to make updates to their info later on.

## [Production Painting & Decorating, Inc](https://production-painting-decorating-inc.vercel.app/)

![PPD Inc](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74b8c515-b512-4064-b944-540a86cc6daf)

A brand new landing page, portfolio, and contact page for a commercial painting company in Raleigh, NC. Note: this is a work in progress, and is still in a very early stage. Stay tuned!

My brother's personal landing page. He recently earned his PhD in Bioengineering from Clemson University via MUSC in Charleson, SC. He's a genius.

You know it. You love it. Simple as it gets. Just for fun.
